# Master-s-diploma
This repository contains my master's diploma files, including C++ codes, visual results and diploma text.
The main idea of this diploma is to simulate wildfire with cellular automata with stochastic behaviour.
The key problem is to find optimal strategy of putting out the fire, depending on the loss function.
Visual representaion was made with SFML API.
